Part 1: Principle
The antenna dish has multiple sub-antenna lobes, and the beam direction of each lobe is different. First, switch to the antenna lobe closest to the direction of the ground station, and then rotate the antenna dish so that the antenna beam accurately points to the ground station and maintains high gain.
It is necessary to obtain the current position of the aircraft and the position of the ground station from the flight controller, and calculate the relative azimuth of the ground station accordingly.
