# AirborneAAT
This project is about a type of antenna AAT (Airborne - Antenna - Tracking) module, which is for FPV (First - Person - View) UAVs. It aligns the airborne antenna's beam direction to a specified target location (usually the ground control station) based on the GNSS positioning. It is conducive to extending the RF transmission distance and improving the signal quality.
